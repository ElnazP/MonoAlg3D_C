- Implement pacing in the stimulus protocol
- Use a sparse matrix format and take the matrix out of the alg mesh (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/csparse/csparse.html)
- Check for the number of stimuli and the time for the last stimulus (largests start+duration) berfore calling the function to apply then
- Make a header file with all functions that the user needs to implement in the cell models
- We have to cleanup the cellular models!!
