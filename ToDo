- The EDO solution should be com completely separated from the Grid (see GPU implementation)
- The EDO solver method should not influence the main program (time adaptive or not)
- The Cellular model, stimulus and grid mesh should be provided by dynamic libraries.
- Implement pacing in the stimulus protocol
- Use a sparse matrix format and take the matrix out of the alg mesh (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/csparse/csparse.html)
