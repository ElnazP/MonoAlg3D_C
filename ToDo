- Split the matrix assembly and the linear system solver as user-defined dynamic libraries. Maybe set initial condition will be put here as well
- Correct the domain version that sets the two scars and the fibrosis from file (maybe the error is on extra-data
- Compare the mesh with the mesh from the scientific reports paper
- Use a sparse matrix format and take the matrix out of the alg mesh (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/csparse/csparse.html)
