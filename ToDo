- The EDO solution should be com completely separeated from the Grid (see GPU implementation)
- Decide if we are going to user float or double for numerical operations (GPU is faster with float)
- The Cellular model, stimulus and grid mesh should be provided by dynamic libraries.
- Implement pacing in the stimulus protocol
