- Rewrite the flags parsing using: https://github.com/kgabis/kgflags/blob/master/examples/full_api.c
- Correct the domain version that sets the two scars and the fibrosis from file (maybe the error is on extra-data)
- Compare the mesh with the mesh from the scientific reports paper
- Use a sparse matrix format and take the matrix out of the alg mesh (http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/csparse/csparse.html)
- Rewrite some library APIs (maybe we need only the config to be passed to the library function)

Berg
- Implement 'save_vtk_polydata_grid_as_vtu_compressed' function
- Implement coupling between Purkinje and tissue
    - Build a separate module to only solve the Purkinje (Try to be as general as possible ...)
    - Move the solution from the Purkinje as the RHS of the tissue (we need to map the cells Purkinje->Tissue)
        - Create a (struct terminal), which will store the indexes from both domains ...
        - Create a function to link the Purkinje cells with the tissue ones
    - Create SAVE_MESH functions to properly write the outputs
- Implement the GMRES linear system solver (see Bernardo's book as reference ...)
- Implement an APD map writer to VTU
