1) Merged Sachetto changes since 22/04/2019
    - Fill discretization matrix with different sigmas is working fine for the default case
    - Each 'struct cell' now has a (sigma_x,sigma_y,sigma_z) 

2) New features
    - New mixed celular models
        + A new "extra_library" has been added (extra_mixed_models)
        + This library is responsible for deciding which celular model of each cell on the grid (mask_functions) 
        + New examples for testing mixed celular models have been added 
    - Different sigmas
        + Simulations where we had cells with different sigmas are now working properly
        + New "source_sink_mismatch" simulation with different sigmas has been added

2) New scripts
    - New script to calculate the APD based on Elnaz's algorithm
        + Works with multiples AP's by passing the pacing period
        + We can now set the percentage of the APD we want

    - New script to calculate the APD of specific cells in the grid (scripts/calc_apd_multiple_cells)
    - New script to calculate the APD of all the cells in the grid (scripts/calc_apd_full_grid) 
    - New script to plot the APD error as a VTU file
    - New script for the butterfly plot

3) New celular model
    - New Mitchell & Shaeffer 2003
    - New mixed celular models
        + Mitchell & Shaeffer + FitzHugh-Nagumo
        + TenTusscher Epicardium + TenTusscher Myocardium

4) New stimulus 
    - New concave stimulus
    
5) New assembly matrix function
    - source_sink_discretization_matrix_with_different_sigma

6) New domain function
    - initialize_grid_with_plain_source_sink_fibrotic_mesh

7) New simulations
    - Source-Sink simulation
    - Plain mesh Ohara & Rudy 2011 simulation
