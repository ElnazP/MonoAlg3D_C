1) Merged Sachetto changes since 05/06/2019
    - New base64 encoding 
    - New 'save_activation_time' function on the save_mesh library 

2) New simulations
    - Elnaz:
        + elnaz_plain_mesh_fibrotic_region:
    Simulation where we specify a fibrotic region inside the tissue and cover this area with 
    fibrotic cells based on the 'phi' parameter.
        + elnaz_plain_mesh_spiral:
    Simulation where we are trying to generate a spiral wave using the TenTusscher 2004 epi model
        + elnaz_plain_mesh_tentusscher:
    Simulation where we test several celular models in order to compare the activation times.

    - Pedro:
        + pedro_plain_mesh_fibrotic_region_with_slow_conductivity
    Simulation where we can specify a fibrotic region and also change the conductivity of the
    cells inside this area by setting a 'sigma_factor' parameter.
        + pedro_scientific_reports_fig_4a
    Simulation where we change all the cells that have fibrosis on the original simulation of the
    Nature paper to cells where their conductivities are decreased by a certain factor.
 
3) New scripts
    - New version of the script to calculate propagation velocity of the whole grid using an activation map
    - New script to plot the APD of the cells which are within a line over the tissue
    - New script to calculate the absolute error between two VTU files.
